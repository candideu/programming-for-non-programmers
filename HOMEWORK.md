Programming For Non-Programmers
===============================

Session 1 Homework
------------------

Build an _About_ page for your site.
Add some images and text to practice with all the tags
and CSS we have learned so far.
Reuse the CSS file from the `index.html`.

You can try things like:
- Adding photos of yourself
- A table with the places you've worked on and the period you worked there
- A list of your favorite meals
- A top 10 of your favorite movies

Any list that doesn't include _The Godfather_ gets -25 points.
